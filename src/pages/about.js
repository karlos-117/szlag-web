      Szlag is an inclusive initiative crystalized from the need of connection in isolation. Serving as a bridge between the underground scenes of various cities and countries, it will facilitate inspiring collabs, promote local artists, empower new talents and defy music genres under various shapes and forms.
      Weâ€™d like the values and concepts embodied in the project to contribute to and nurture the music scene which has lately been both challenged by the pandemic and commercialized to the bone.
