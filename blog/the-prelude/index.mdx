To all the curious music-thirsty minds, we are pleased to finally invite you to celebrate the inauguration of our new project.
Come meet us for a trip from ambient & experimental, deconstructed sounds through electro, breaks, EBM, dark & synth wave, all the way to distorted and rave'y techno served by:

× DJ NOSEBLUNT (WE LECIM, Katowice) b2b VODEC (Tech-Room 29, Wrocław)

All of that in a lovely SOUNDS Garten open-air location on an upgraded Funktion One soundsystem.
