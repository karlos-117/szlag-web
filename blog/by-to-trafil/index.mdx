Szlag by to TRafił is a weekend event by the well known Wrocław collective Tech-room 29 and the newly founded szlag project.
Szlag is an inclusive initiative of Kasia Gościńska ​​serving as a bridge between the underground scenes of various cities and countries, facilitating inspiring collabs and promoting music diversity.
In the spirit of the concept, we are joining forces to create a special 3-day music journey by artists from Wrocław, Berlin, Warsaw, Poznań and more. All that in the Wake Trip Cablepark location, surrounded by a forest and a lake. We will be travelling through various music styles, starting with a faster rave’y acid and industrial techno, through house, electro, breaks, EBM up to an ambient/experimental end of the trip.
